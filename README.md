## Swing Calculator By U23/CS/1009

This is a simple calculator application built using **Java** and the **Swing GUI** toolkit. It supports basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with buttons for each operation, making it easy to perform calculations.

## Why I Buildt This
I created this calculator as a simple project to practice using Java Swing. My goal is to make an intuitive app that could handle basic calculations while being easy to use. I also want to expand my knowledege of java and experiment more.

## Features

- **Basic Operations**: Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division.
- **Clear and Reset Functionality**: Clear the input field with the 'C' button.
- **User-friendly Interface**: A clean, easy-to-navigate GUI with buttons for numbers and operators.
- **Display**: The result of the calculations is displayed in real-time.

## How to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/swing-calculator-matNo.git
   ```
   
2. **Compile the Java code**:
   Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory and run:
   ```bash
   javac SwingJavaApplication.java
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   After compiling the code, run the application:
   ```bash
   java SwitchJavaApplication.java
   ```

 ## Keyoard Shortcuts
 1. '+' for addition
 2. '-' for subtraction
 3. '*' for multiplication
 4. '/' for division
 5. '%' for modulus
 6. 'C' to clear the input field


## Requirements

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** installed on your machine (JDK 8 or higher).
- A Java IDE or terminal/command prompt for compiling and running the Java code.
